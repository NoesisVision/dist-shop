# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dist-shop system is a distributed e-commerce platform built using .NET microservices architecture. The system follows domain-driven design principles with clear bounded contexts for inventory management, product catalog, shipment tracking, search functionality, and shopping orchestration. The system uses event-driven architecture for internal communication while exposing REST APIs for external clients.
